Installation
------------

a) copy the two files to your simpleID PHP directory (wherever the
   other simpleID *.inc files are kept)

b) rename the config file

   mv ldap-filesystem.store.config.php-sample ldap-filesystem.store.config.php

c) edit the config file, specify the LDAP server name and LDAP_BASE_DN

d) modify the main simpleID config file, config.inc, and change
   the store parameter like so:

      define('SIMPLEID_STORE', 'ldap-filesystem');

e) for each user, create a normal identity file, but add this extra
   line in the file somewhere:

      auth_method="LDAP"

   If the module sees this auth_method, it will authenticate against
   LDAP.  If no auth_method is specified, or if you specify
   auth_method="STATIC", it will just use the password hash within
   the identity file.

How it works
------------

- the module makes an anonymous bind to the LDAP server

- it looks at the username from the login form,
  
  - if it contains an @ symbol, it will search the LDAP server for
    a user with the `mail' attribute matching the login name
  - otherwise, it will search for a user with the matching `uid' attribute

- if more than one LDAP entry is found, access is denied

- it attempts to re-bind to the LDAP server using the DN of the 
  matched LDAP entry, and using the password supplied in the login
  form

- if the re-bind is successful, access is granted
